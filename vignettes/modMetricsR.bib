  abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have suggested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance.},

  abstract = {Watershed models are powerful tools for simulating the effect of watershed processes and management on soil and water resources. However, no comprehensive guidance is available to facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data compared to measured flow and constituent values. Thus, the objectives of this research were to: (1) determine recommended model evaluation techniques (statistical and graphical), (2) review reported ranges of values and corresponding performance ratings for the recommended statistics, and (3) establish guidelines for model evaluation based on the review results and project-specific considerations; all of these objectives focus on simulation of streamflow and transport of sediment and nutrients. These objectives were achieved with a thorough review of relevant literature on model application and recommended model evaluation methods. Based on this analysis, we recommend that three quantitative statistics, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), in addition to the graphical techniques, be used in model evaluation. The following model evaluation performance ratings were established for each recommended statistic. In general, model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if NSE {$>$} 0.50 and RSR {$<$} 0.70, and if PBIAS + 25\% for streamflow, PBIAS + 55\% for sediment, and PBIAS + 70\% for N and P. For PBIAS, constituent-specific performance ratings were determined based on uncertainty of measured data. Additional considerations related to model evaluation guidelines are also discussed. These considerations include: single-event simulation, quality and quantity of measured data, model calibration procedure, evaluation time step, and project scope and magnitude. A case study illustrating the application of the model evaluation guidelines is also provided.},

  abstract = {Enteric methane (CH4) production from cattle contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions. Measurement of enteric CH4 is complex, expensive, and impractical at large scales; therefore, models are commonly used to predict CH4 production. However, building robust prediction models requires extensive data from animals under different management systems worldwide. The objectives of this study were to (1) collate a global database of enteric CH4 production from individual lactating dairy cattle; (2) determine the availability of key variables for predicting enteric CH4 production (g/day per cow), yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)], and intensity (g/kg energy corrected milk) and their respective relationships; (3) develop intercontinental and regional models and cross-validate their performance; and (4) assess the trade-off between availability of on-farm inputs and CH4 prediction accuracy. The intercontinental database covered Europe (EU), the United States (US), and Australia (AU). A sequential approach was taken by incrementally adding key variables to develop models with increasing complexity. Methane emissions were predicted by fitting linear mixed models. Within model categories, an intercontinental model with the most available independent variables performed best with root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) as a percentage of mean observed value of 16.6\%, 14.7\%, and 19.8\% for intercontinental, EU, and United States regions, respectively. Less complex models requiring only DMI had predictive ability comparable to complex models. Enteric CH4 production, yield, and intensity prediction models developed on an intercontinental basis had similar performance across regions, however, intercepts and slopes were different with implications for prediction. Revised CH4 emission conversion factors for specific regions are required to improve CH4 production estimates in national inventories. In conclusion, information on DMI is required for good prediction, and other factors such as dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration, improve the prediction. For enteric CH4 yield and intensity prediction, information on milk yield and composition is required for better estimation.},

  abstract = {A common and simple approach to evaluate models is to regress predicted vs. observed values (or vice versa) and compare slope and intercept parameters against the 1:1 line. However, based on a review of the literature it seems to be no consensus on which variable (predicted or observed) should be placed in each axis. Although some researchers think that it is identical, probably because r2 is the same for both regressions, the intercept and the slope of each regression differ and, in turn, may change the result of the model evaluation. We present mathematical evidence showing that the regression of predicted (in the y-axis) vs. observed data (in the x-axis) (PO) to evaluate models is incorrect and should lead to an erroneous estimate of the slope and intercept. In other words, a spurious effect is added to the regression parameters when regressing PO values and comparing them against the 1:1 line. Observed (in the y-axis) vs. predicted (in the x-axis) (OP) regressions should be used instead. We also show in an example from the literature that both approaches produce significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation.},

  abstract = {When evaluating the performance of quantitative models, dimensioned errors often are characterized by sums-of-squares measures such as the mean squared error (MSE) or its square root, the root mean squared error (RMSE). In terms of quantifying average error, however, absolute-value-based measures such as the mean absolute error (MAE) are more interpretable than MSE or RMSE. Part of that historical preference for sums-of-squares measures is that they are mathematically amenable to decomposition and one can then form ratios, such as those based on separating MSE into its systematic and unsystematic components. Here, we develop and illustrate a decomposition of MAE into three useful submeasures: (1) bias error, (2) proportionality error, and (3) unsystematic error. This three-part decomposition of MAE is preferable to comparable decompositions of MSE because it provides more straightforward information on the nature of the model-error distribution. We illustrate the properties of our new three-part decomposition using a long-term reconstruction of streamflow for the Upper Colorado River.},

  abstract = {The appearance of numerous plots in recent literature from which the residuals are plotted against observed values (Y) to assess a model's potential bias raises this question: should residuals be regressed against Y or against predicted values (Y\textasciicircum )? The answer requires knowing the expected relationship under the assumption of an unbiased model. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to derive the expected relationship between residuals, Y, and Y\textasciicircum; 2) to determine whether Y or Y\textasciicircum{} should be used for the assessment of bias; and 3) to reassess the extent of mean and linear bias in the prediction of N flows to the duodenum by the NRC (2001). In the simplest case, we can assume a true model of the form Y=X{$\beta$}+{$\varepsilon$}. This model is estimated by Y=Xb+e, and Y\textasciicircum =Xb. The correlation between the residual vector e and the vector of observations Y can easily be derived. The numerator of the correlation coefficient is shown to be equal to e{${'}$}e, the residual sum of squares. The denominator of this correlation is equal to the square root of e{${'}$}e multiplied by the total sum of squares. Algebraic simplifications show that the correlation between e and Y is equal to the square root of (1-R2). That is, under the assumption of an unbiased model, the residuals are correlated with the observed values and the slope of e regressed on Y is equal to (1-R2). Thus, a graph of e versus Y will show a positive slope between e and Y unless the model is a perfect predictor (i.e., R2 is equal to 1.0). Significant slopes linking e to Y have been erroneously interpreted as evidence of biased models in the NRC (2001). Conversely, the slope of e regressed on Y\textasciicircum{} is expected to be zero under the assumption of an unbiased model. Therefore, residuals should be regressed against Y\textasciicircum{} and not Y. When Y\textasciicircum, as opposed to Y, was used to assess biases in the prediction of flows to the duodenum of microbial N, nonammonia-nonmicrobial N and nonammonia N in NRC (2001), mean biases became nonsignificant and linear biases over the range of predicted values are of the same magnitude or smaller than the standard errors of measurements reported in literature. Thus, although N flow predictions from NRC (2001) may not be precise, they appear to have insignificant and inconsequential biases.},
