# Before starting

Packages required and number notation.

# Package overview

## Examples

Here examples of use for the functions included.

### opmetrics

With `opmetrics`, which stands for "observed-predicted-metrics", this function can be run just by providing observed and predicted value from the model, as:

```{r}
m <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length , iris)

opmetrics(iris$Petal.Length, predict(m))
```

Great right? But too many digits, we can just add an argument to `s = `, either a number or a standardize format (like `s = "std1"`)

```{r}
opmetrics(iris$Petal.Length, predict(m), s = "std1")
```

If you want observed against prediction just add `plot = TRUE`.
Note that this is made with observed against predicted, as pointed out from [@pineiroHowEvaluateModels2008].

```{r}
opmetrics(iris$Petal.Length, predict(m), plot = TRUE)
```

This object can be used as any ggplot, so adding graphics and changing the theme.

```{r}
opmetrics(iris$Petal.Length, predict(m), plot = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Predicted sepal length, cm", y = "Observed sepal length, cm") +
  theme_bw()
```

If you want to plot the residuals instead just add `residuals = TRUE`.
Note residuals are plotted against predicting, as it should be [@st-pierreReassessmentBiasesPredicted2003].

```{r}
opmetrics(iris$Petal.Length, predict(m), plot = TRUE, residuals = TRUE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Predicted sepal length, cm", y = "Residual sepal length, cm") +
  theme_bw()
```

Not a great model, maybe by adding species it could look better.

```{r}
m <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + Species, iris)

opmetrics(iris$Petal.Length, predict(m), plot = TRUE, residuals = TRUE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Predicted sepal length, cm", y = "Residual sepal length, cm") +
  theme_bw()
```

### metricsloop

With `metricsloop` is possible to compare metrics fom different models beloning to the same model class, just by providing the models of interest, thanks to the loop built in the function.

```{r}
mods <- c("Sepal.Length",
          "Sepal.Length+Species",
          "Sepal.Length*Species")

metricsloop(d = iris, var = "Petal.Length", MT = "lm", m = mods, PF = "predict", s = "std1")
```

And for better table visualization via flextable, of course is also possible to print it as csv/spreadsheet.

```{r}
flextable(metricsloop(d = iris, var = "Petal.Length", MT = "lm", m = mods, PF = "predict", s = "std1")
) %>% autofit()
```


### metricsloopmix

With `metricsloopmix` is possible to compare metrics fom different models beloning to the different model classes, just by providing the models of interest, thanks to the loop built in the function.

```{r}
modclass <- c("lm", "glm")
modsid <- c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Length, family = Gamma")

modsdata <- data.frame(modclass, modsid)

metricsloopmix(d = iris, var = "Petal.Length", MO = modsdata, s = "std1")
```

Is also possible to use different `predict functinos` by setting `PF = TRUE`, and additing a third column the the `MO` data with the prediction function intended for each model.

```{r}
modclass <- c("lm", "glm")
modsid <- c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Length, family = Gamma")
modpredict <- c("predict.lm", "predict.glm")
predictype <- c("response", "response")

modsdata <- data.frame(modclass, modsid, modpredict,predictype)

metricsloopmix(d = iris, var = "Petal.Length", MO = modsdata, PF = TRUE, s = "std1")
```

And for better table visualization via flextable.

```{r}
flextable(metricsloopmix(d = iris, var = "Petal.Length", MO = modsdata, PF = TRUE, s = "std1")) %>% autofit()
```


## Metrics included

Following a list of the metrics included. Where ${Y}_i$ is the observed values, $\hat{Y}_i$ is the predicted values from the model, $n$ is the number of observations, $\mu$ is the average of the observed values, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the observed values.


### Mean Square Error {-}
Can be used as such, or to calculate the proportion of the decompose error [@bibbyPredictionImprovedEstimation1977a].

$$ MSE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\hat{Y}_i)^2 }{n} $$


### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) {-}
As absolute value and as proportion of the mean observed values. Main indicator of goodness of a model [@bibbyPredictionImprovedEstimation1977a].

$$ RMSE = \sqrt{MSE} \text{ or } \sqrt{MSE}/\mu$$

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE) {-}

Simular to the RMSE but with a lower weight of the residuals further from the zero [@chaiRootMeanSquare2014]. As for the RMSE it can be divided by $\mu$ to have the MAE as a proportion of the mean observed values. 

$$ MAE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n|Y_i-{\hat{Y}_i}|}{n} $$

### Mean Bias {-}
Expressed as percentage of MSE, and calculated as squared bias.

$$ MB = \biggr[  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\hat{Y}_i)}{n} \biggr]^2 $$

### Random Bias (DB) {-}
Expressed as percentage of MSE. 

From the regression:

$$ Y_i - \hat{Y}_i = \hat{Y}_i + \epsilon_i $$


$$ DB = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\epsilon_i^2 }{n} $$

### Slope Bias (SB) {-}
Expressed as percentage of MSE.

$$ SP = MSE - MB - DB $$

### RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) {-}
Calcualted as presented in @moriasid.n.ModelEvaluationGuidelines2007.

$$ RSR = RMSE/\sigma $$


### Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) {-}
Calculated according to @linConcordanceCorrelationCoefficient1989 using the R package @stevensonEpiRToolsAnalysis2023.


# Fomulas not included but to consider  {.hidden .unlisted}

## Alternative mean bias formulation

$$ MB =  \biggr[ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i}{n}-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat{Y}_i)}{n}  \biggr] ^2 $$
